### It's me, Al! 👋

First of all, full disclosure: my full name is Álvaro (emphasis on the accent), but since it's not quite international, I've learnt that 'Al' works _just fine_. Feel free to call me however you feel like 😊

My story is really _cliché_: Boy loves code, believes that code is just for math geniuses, boy meets tech community and realises that it's actually feasible to learn and actually become good at it. I started back in October 2021 and I can say that I'm **in love** with coding.

So far, I feel confident with:
-HTML5
-CSS3
-JavaScript

I'm currently learning:
-React
-JavaScript (because there's simply too much to learn)

I've bought a Udemy course about and I swear that I'll eventually start it:
-SaSS
